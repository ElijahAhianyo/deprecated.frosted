Which, in my opinion, is a must have feature.\r\n- Frosted implements the .editorconfig standard for configuration. This means you only need one configuration file for isort, frosted, and all the code editors anybody working with your project may be using.\r\n- Frosted uses a more logical, self-documenting, and standard terminal interface. With pyflakes the default action without any arguments is to do nothing (waiting for stdin) with Frosted you get an error and help.\r\n- Frosted switched from Java style unittests to the more Pythonic py.test (I admit this is highly subjective).\r\n- The number one reason frosted is better is because of you! Or rather, the Python community at large. I will quickly respond to any pull requests, recommendations, or bug reports that come my way.\r\n- Frosting. Duh.\r\n\r\nAnd it will only get better from here on out!\r\n\r\nConfiguring Frosted\r\n======================\r\n\r\nIf you find the default frosted settings do not work well for your project, frosted provides several ways to adjust\r\nthe behavior.\r\n\r\nTo configure frosted for a single user create a ~/.frosted.cfg file:\r\n\r\n    [settings]\r\n    skip=file3.py,file4.py\r\n    ignore_frosted_errors=101,105,110\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can specify project level configuration simply by placing a .frosted.cfg file at the root of your\r\nproject. frosted will look up to 25 directories up, from the one it is ran, to find a project specific configuration.\r\n\r\nYou can then override any of these settings by using command line arguments, or by passing in kwargs into any of the\r\nexposed api checking methods.\r\n\r\nFinally, frosted supports editorconfig files using the standard syntax defined here:\r\nhttp://editorconfig.org/\r\n\r\nMeaning You can place any standard isort configuration parameters within a .editorconfig file under the *.py section\r\nand they will be honored.\r\n\r\nFrosted Error-codes\r\n======================\r\n\r\nFrosted recognizes the following errors when present within your code. You can use the 'ignore_frosted_errors' setting to\r\nspecify any errors you want Frosted to ignore.\r\n\r\n- **100**: Generic Message\r\n- **101**: UnusedImport\r\n- **102**: RedefinedWhileUnused\r\n- **103**: RedefinedInListComp\r\n- **104**: ImportShadowedByLoopVar\r\n- **105**: ImportStarUsed\r\n- **106**: UndefinedName\r\n- **107**: DoctestSyntaxError\r\n- **108**: UndefinedExport\r\n- **109**: UndefinedLocal\r\n- **110**: DuplicateArgument\r\n- **111**: Redefined\r\n- **112**: LateFutureImport\r\n- **113**: UnusedVariable\r\n- **114**: MultipleValuesForArgument\r\n- **115**: TooFewArguments\r\n- **116**: TooManyArguments\r\n- **117**: UnexpectedArgument\r\n- **118**: NeedKwOnlyArgument\r\n- **119**: ReturnWithArgsInsideGenerator\r\n\r\nFrosted Code API\r\n===================\r\n\r\nFrosted exposes a simple API for checking Python code from withing other Python applications or plugins.\r\n\r\n- frosted.api.check (codeString, filename, reporter=modReporter.Default, **setting_overrides)\r\n  Check the Python source given by codeString for unfrosted flakes.\r\n- frosted.api.check_path (filename, reporter=modReporter.Default, **setting_overrides)\r\n  Check the given path, printing out any warnings detected.\r\n- frosted.check_recursive (paths, reporter=modReporter.Default, **setting_overrides)\r\n  Recursively check all source files defined in paths.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can use the command line tool in an API fashion, by passing '-' in as the filename and then sending\r\nfile content to stdin.\r\n\r\nWhy did you fork pyflakes?\r\n===================\r\n\r\nPyflakes was a great project, and introduced a great approach for quickly checking for Python syntax errors. I am very grateful to the original creators.\r\nHowever, I feel over the last year it has become stagnate, without a clear vision and someone willing to take true ownership of the project.\r\nWhile I know it is in no way intentional, critical failures have stayed open, despite perfectly complete and valid pull-requests open, without so much as an acknowledgement from the maintainer.\r\nAs I genuinely believe open source projects need constant improvement (releasing early and often), I decided to start this project and look for as much\r\ninput as possible from the Python community. I'm hoping together we can build an even more awesome syntax checker!\r\n\r\nNote: the maintainer of pyflakes has been added as a contributer to frosted.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThanks and I hope you enjoy the new Frosted pyflakes!\r\n\r\n~Timothy Crosley\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
